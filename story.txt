There was once a girl who lived in Madison. She was in a computer science class and worked hard to finish all the assignments. She hoped one day she would graduate.
She once came across a team in her computer science class. They were forced to create a story using git. Each team member had to add their own part to the story.
Those stories are made up by each team member from lyrics or poem. They did it beautifully, and did it well. 
They were sure to recieve an excellent grade. Their team work helping each other collaborate was a success. She was another step further on her way to graduation.  
In the end they got an A+. Everything was right in the world! The girl could finally graduate!
